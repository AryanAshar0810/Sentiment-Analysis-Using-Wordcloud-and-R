# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Wordcloud-and-R

Word clouds can be a useful visualisation to quickly view the most used words in a block of text. R has the 
wordcloud function in the wordcloud package that can be used to quickly generate these plots. Sentiment 
analysis is an important part of the emotion computing and wordcloud is a fancy way of text visualization. 
Combining the two, we can reveal and display peopleâ€™s attitude and perspectives through their comments or 
articles. The following code is used to display the sentiments and emotions of a person using his/her comments. The code is also used to display emotions present in the text and is thus used to analyse the text. 

The guide contains the complete output as well as the code along with all the graphs. The explaination of the code has been added in the guide. PLease do refer to the same.
